Trust-Based Game Theory Network Routing

Project Overview: This project demonstrates the application of game theory in network routing by calculating and visualizing trust-based paths between nodes. It highlights how strategic decision-making can optimize routing reliability and security.

Features
- Assigns dynamic trust scores between nodes.
- Calculates all possible paths between a source and destination.
- Identifies the highest trust path and visualizes it.
- Interactive graph representation using matplotlib and networkx.

Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
    networkx: For graph-based network representation.
    matplotlib: For visualizing the network and paths.

How to Run
Pre-requisites:
Install Python (3.6 or later).

Install required libraries using:
pip install networkx matplotlib

Run the Program:

Execute the script using:
python trust_based_routing.py

Expected Output:

A network graph will be displayed showing:
Nodes and edges with trust scores.
The optimal path (highlighted in yellow
